Bubble Sort
****************
Buddle sort for ascending order:

The Bubble Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that works in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of items to be sorted. 
The first iteration of the Bubble Sort sorts the input item at index 0 into ascending order, 
and then repeats this process until all the inputs have been sorted

Buddle sort for decending order: 

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if order is wrong. 
Descending order :- Numbers are said to be in descending order when they are arranged from largest to smallest number. 
Such as 21, 17, 13, 9 and 3 are arranged in descending order.


Selection Sort:
****************
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element 
from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of 
the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. This process is repeated for 
the remaining unsorted portion of the list until the entire list is sorted. One variation of 
selection sort is called “Bidirectional selection sort” which goes through the list of elements 
by alternating between the smallest and largest element, this way the algorithm can be faster in some cases.

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

The subarray which already sorted. 
The remaining subarray was unsorted.
In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the beginning of the unsorted subarray. 

After every iteration sorted subarray size increase by one and the unsorted subarray size decrease by

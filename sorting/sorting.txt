Bubble Sort
****************
Buddle sort for ascending order:

The Bubble Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that works in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of items to be sorted. 
The first iteration of the Bubble Sort sorts the input item at index 0 into ascending order, 
and then repeats this process until all the inputs have been sorted

Buddle sort for decending order: 

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if order is wrong. 
Descending order :- Numbers are said to be in descending order when they are arranged from largest to smallest number. 
Such as 21, 17, 13, 9 and 3 are arranged in descending order.
